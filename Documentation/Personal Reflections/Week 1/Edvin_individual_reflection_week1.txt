-what do I want to learn or understand better?
 
 I want to learn about the parts of the project not pertaining directly 
 to software development from my business management teammates. 
 I also hope to learn more about how to be a part of a team that 
 is working together on some sort of project, and how such a team 
 maintains balance.


-how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 
 By providing a positive attitude and investing myself in the questions and 
 concerns of my teammates, I can be the most helpful to them. By always sharing
 what I know and not expecting that people figure out solutions to problems on 
 their own when they ask for help, I contribute to our collaborative effort and
 can help drive the project forward. 


-what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
 
 I have attended excercises in scrum workflow along with my team, and I plan to
 learn more about scrum as we start working on our project.


-what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

 I have helped out in constructing the social contract of our group, and in
 discussing ideas for what we are going to produce in our project. I plan to
 continue to collaborate with my group next week so we can establish more 
 details about what we are going to do, such as what type of software we will
 make (mobile app or web service, for example).
